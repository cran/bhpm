Description: Bayesian hierarchical methods for the detection of differences in rates of related outcomes for multiple treatments for clustered observations. Theoretical background for the models is given in Carragher (2017) <https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.736866>. The models in this package are extensions for multiple treatments and clusters. This software was developed for the Precision Drug Theraputics: Risk Prediction in Pharmacoepidemiology project as part of a Rutherford Fund Fellowship at Health Data Research (UK), Medical Research Council (UK) award reference MR/S003967/1 (<https://gtr.ukri.org/>). Principal Investigator: Raymond Carragher.
